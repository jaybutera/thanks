Thanks is a compiler of a [custom file format](https://github.com/jaybutera/thanks/blob/master/docs/file_format.md) to an IPFS knowledge graph.

```
Complex ideas, deep beliefs and theories are not brought into existence in one
Eureka moment. Our most creative thoughts are often the most spontaneous.
They come to mind in unexpected moments.

When awareness is kept on a creative thought, there becomes a chain of
thoughts, often branching in different directions. Sometimes connecting with
other parallel branches of thought.

Polished and complete concepts are the product of the natural thought process.
They are a combination of logical iteration and creative connection between
seemingly unrelated concepts.

Through this thought process, you may write thoughts so as to
preserve them beyond the sandy beaches of your own brain's memory. But
documents are not so flexible. They don't share the same indexing and
non-linearity as the mind.

The thoughts become stale. Difficult to reference and draw connections. Only
those with discipline and their own systems of organization are able to draw
conclusions and formulate abstract concepts from the mess and mass of data in
their mind.

For ease of use, lets call the most primitive chunks of thought, a thunk. A
thunk can be an independent thought which pops into your mind from nowhere in
particular. Or it can be an idea derived from other concepts, other thunks.

By recording your thunks you may find patterns and abstract concepts which you
want to extrapolate. For example in your notes from two different books, you
realize both authors have a similar idea. This realization is a new thunk,
which derives from existing notions.

Therefore thunks may reference other thunks. Forming an explicit graph of
interconnections between branching trees of thoughts and concepts.

Thus emerges a network or internetwork of thoughts and ideas.

By adopting the discipline of dividing thoughts into discrete peices, so that
each peice is individually referencable, a high-precision graph of knowledge
emerges. Which can be probed and built upon from any angle, branching into new
territories and making distant connections without difficulty.

Perhaps not all thunks of knowledge in this graph are your own. Perhaps you
only play a role in building on an existing open-knowledge graph. Collaboration
is easy.

It's all very easy. This is a revolution on documents. We know the model fits
well if you feel like you are simply going through the thought process. No
overhead concerning yourself with documents structures. Simply write down your
thoughts free form, or aggregate disparate thunks when researching, or make
comments on a branch of thunks you made last week, or that a friend made.
